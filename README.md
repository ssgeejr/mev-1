# Cybersecurity Tabletop Presentation

## Cybersecurity Breach Demonstration - System Roles

![Tabletop Scenario Overview](tabletop-servers.png)


## Tabletop Servers

## üíª Smallpox ‚Äî Remote Command and Control (C2)
*Smallpox is our cloud-hosted attack infrastructure. It acts as the command and control server ‚Äî receiving connections from compromised machines, issuing payloads, and coordinating the breach from outside the hospital network. It demonstrates how attackers can operate from anywhere in the world, maintain persistent access, and pivot through internal systems without ever physically touching the environment.*

---

## üß™ Sepsis ‚Äî Cloud-Based Attack Platform with Dedicated Domain
*Sepsis is a cloud-hosted, multi-role attack server operating under its own domain name. It simulates a real-world threat actor‚Äôs infrastructure, running three distinct services on separate ports: a spoofed Adobe update site for malware delivery, a credential capture system for phishing, and a man-in-the-middle proxy for email interception. This configuration shows how attackers can stage full-spectrum campaigns entirely from the cloud, using realistic domains and infrastructure to evade detection and gain trust.*

---

## üíª Anthrax ‚Äî Local Threat Actor Workstation
*Anthrax is the physical laptop used by the threat actor while operating from a public location ‚Äî in this case, the fictional StarHacks Coffee House. It simulates an attacker connecting from an untrusted, external network (like public Wi-Fi), launching targeted attacks against hospital devices such as Ringworm. Anthrax represents the initial compromise vector, capturing how external access and poor user decisions can lead to internal breaches.*

---

## üíº Ringworm ‚Äî The Roninette‚Äôs Compromised Laptop
*Ringworm is the endpoint device assigned to the fictional employee, the Roninette. It‚Äôs the first system breached outside the hospital network, simulating what happens when a user connects to public Wi-Fi and opens a malicious file. Later in the demonstration, Ringworm is compromised again through a man-in-the-middle email attack, highlighting how layered exploitation can occur across different environments and attack vectors.*

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Chagas ‚Äî Exposed Production Server
*Chagas is a production server assumed to be safely protected within the hospital‚Äôs internal network. However, due to a critical misconfiguration, it was unintentionally exposed to the guest network. This oversight allowed a pivoted attack from a previously compromised endpoint, demonstrating how even well-segmented infrastructure can be breached when boundary controls fail.*


## üé≠ Role-Playing Scenario ‚Äî Tabletop Exercise

**Robinette**, one of the directors at *Willow Creek Community Hospital*, a small rural hospital, finishes her morning tasks. She packs her hospital-issued laptop into her bag and leaves the office; her employee badge still clipped to her blazer. The badge displays her name, title, and the hospital‚Äôs logo. Wanting to review some reports, she decides to stop by *StarHacks*, a cozy coffee shop near the hospital, before continuing her day.

At *StarHacks*, Robinette orders a chamomile tea, settles at a small table, and opens her laptop. She connects to the coffee shop‚Äôs open Wi-Fi network, **"StarHacks_Guest,"** which requires no password. The unsecured network leaves her device exposed, but Robinette, focused on work, doesn‚Äôt notice. She logs in and begins reviewing reports and responding to emails from her team.

**Agent Smith**, a cybercriminal, is already at StarHacks, monitoring the open Wi-Fi with a packet-sniffing tool to identify vulnerable devices. As he scans the room, he notices Robinette‚Äôs badge, clearly showing her role as a director at Willow Creek Community Hospital. Recognizing the hospital as a potential target for sensitive patient data, he zeroes in on her laptop‚Äôs network activity, preparing to exploit the unsecured connection.
